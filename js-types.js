// For this assignment you'll need to concatenate (add together) your first name and last name into a string.
// Assign the result of the string concatenation to a variable: name 
 
 
// Add two numbers together, and assign the result in a variable: calculation 
// Add a number and a string together. Store the result in a variable: unexpected 
// What happened?  Why? 

const first = 'Tyler ';
let middle = 'Coder ';

console.log (name = first + middle + last);

let a = 79;
let b = 1654;

console.log( calculation = a + b)

let bigMacEaten = 10;

console.log(unexpected = bigMacEaten + whatHappens);
// it concatinated the number and the string. because we added them together??
